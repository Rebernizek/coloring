                <h1> HEALTH<br> </h1>

                <h2>Yellow July – Viral Hepatitis <br><br></h2>

                <p class="description">
                The color yellow symbolizes attention, alert, and prevention, which is why it is used to highlight the importance of combating hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.

                The focus is on encouraging:

                Free testing (available through the SUS - Brazilian public health system)

                Vaccination against hepatitis B

                Awareness about transmission (contaminated blood, unprotected sex, contaminated water/food – in the case of hepatitis A)

                Early treatment, which prevents cirrhosis and liver cancer<br><br>

                </p>




                <h2>Green July – Head and Neck Cancer <br><br></h2>

                <p class="description">
                    The color green here represents health and prevention.

                The campaign aims to raise awareness about risk factors such as:

                Smoking

                Alcohol

                HPV

                It also encourages observation of signs such as mouth sores that do not heal, persistent hoarseness, and difficulty swallowing.

                </p>



                <h1>SOCIAL</h1>


                <p class="description">
                    July has fewer social campaigns consolidated by color, but some regions use the month for actions such as:

                Donation of warm clothing

                Community winter mobilizations

                These don't have an official color, but they are part of the social activities practiced during the month.
                </p>




                <h1> ENVIRONMENTAL</h1>

                <p class="description">
                July doesn't have a national color for environmental causes, but many NGOs carry out:

                Recycling campaigns

                Campaigns about the conscious use of water and energy

                because of the school holidays, when there is greater circulation of people and educational activities.
